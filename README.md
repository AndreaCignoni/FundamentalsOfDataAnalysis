# Part 1: Tasks

## Task 1: Collatz Conjecture Verification

### Overview

The *Collatz conjecture* is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics stating that a defined function applied to any positive integer **x** will always lead to the repeating sequence $1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2,1, 2, 3,\ldots$

### Function Definition

The function $f(x)$ is defined as follows:

![!\[image\\](https://github.com/AndreaCignoni/FundamentalsOfDataAnalysis/blob/883d336e071f6d3b79a60383381ce08c091c97e9/img/Formula.png)

### Code devolepment

In order to prove that the *Collatz conjecture* to be true, I have first defined a function *f(x)* implementing the mathematical calculation, then I have created the format how this same function operates in a variable named *collatz()* and, finally, I have encapsulated the iterative process within a loop using a another variable to prove the conjecture's validity for the first 100,000 positive integers. My task was then to verify, using Python, that the *Collatz conjecture* holds true for the first 10,000 positive integers.

## Task 2: Overview of the Famous Penguins Dataset

### Overview

The **Famous Penguins dataset** is a well-known dataset often used in data science and machine learning. It contains information about various penguin species, providing a basis for exploring and understanding the characteristics of these aquatic birds. The raw cvs file was  is downloaded from [mwaskom/seaborn-data Github](https://github.com/mwaskom/) and read using Pandas' **pd.read_csv()** method.

### Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following variables:  **Species**: The species of the penguin: *Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, *Gentoo*; **Island**: The islands where the penguins were observed are *Biscoe*, *Dream*, *Torgersen*; **Bill Length**, **Bill Depth**, **Flipper Length** in millimeters; **Body Mass** in grams; **Sex**: *male* and *female*

### Variable Types

1. **Categorical Variables**

The dataset contains three categorical variables that are *species*, *islands* and *sex* where the first two can be considered as *nominal categorical variables* and the latter  a *nominal variable of the dichotomous type*.

2. **Continuous Variables**

*Bill Length (mm)*, *Bill Depth (mm)*, *Flipper Length (mm)*, *Body Mass (g)* are all continuous variables representing physical characteristics of the penguins. In the data set description, rhey were analysed using Pandas' **describe()** function to provide summary statistics.

## Task 3: Probability Distribution Modeling for Penguins Dataset Variables

### Overview

In Task 3, the assignment consists in selecting an appropriate probability distribution from the **NumPy random distributions list** for modeling each variable in the Famous Penguins dataset.

### Variables and Probability Distributions chosen

**Categorical Variables**

- Species and Island:
The **Multinomial distribution** is suitable for the categorical variables *Species* and *Island,* capturing the probability distribution across multiple categories. 
+ Sex:
The **Binomial distribution** is chosen for the categorical variable *Sex,* which represents a binary outcome.

**Continuous Variables**

* Bill Length, Bill Depth, Flipper Length:
The observed bimodal pattern in the variables suggests the presence of distinct species within the dataset. Given the symmetric spread around the mean, a **Normal distribution** is chosen for modelling the first curve  of the *Bill Length* and both curves for the *Bill Depth* and the *Flipper Length*. The irregular second peak in the *Bill Length* variable is more appropriately modelled by a **Log-normal distribution** due to its specific characteristics.
- Body Mass:
The right-skewed histogram curves with elongated tails on the right side lead to the choice of a **log-normal distribution** for modeling the continuous variable *Body Mass.*

## Task 4: Probability, Expected Values, Surprise, and Entropy

### Concepts Explained

In Task 4, we delve into the concepts of **Probability**, **Expected Values**, **Surprise**, and **Entropy**. These fundamental concepts play a crucial role in understanding the uncertainty associated with random variables and events.

**Entropy** is a measure of the uncertainty or disorder in a set of possible outcomes. It is the expected value of surprise.

Formula:
$H(X) = \sum_{i} P(X=xi) \cdot S(X=xi)$

### Task solution

In the case of flipping two coins, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, or 2 heads. The probabilities for each outcome can be expressed as follows:

Probability of 0 heads: $(1-p)^2$
Probability of 1 head: $2p(1âˆ’p)$
Probability of 2 heads: $p2$

The entropy formula is then applied:

$H(X) = -( (1-p)^2 log_2(1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) log_2(2p(1-p)) + p^2 log_2(p^2) )$

This represents the entropy of the total number of heads when flipping two coins with a probability $p$ of heads. The resulting value would provide a measure of uncertainty or disorder associated with the outcomes.

## Task 5: Visualization of Palmer Penguin Variables using Seaborn

In Task 5, the Palmer penguin dataset was visualised using *Seaborn* to gain insights into the distribution of variables. The following visualizations were created:

- Species Distribution:
A single bar plot using **sns.countplot** was generated for the **Species** variable. The visualisation revealed that the *Adelie* species has the highest representation, followed by *Gentoo*, while *Chinstrap* has the lowest number of samples in the dataset.
+ Species Distribution across Islands:
A bar plot using **sns.countplot** illustrated the distribution of penguin *species* across each island (**Island** variable). The analysis highlighted that the *Adelie* species inhabits all three islands, *Gentoo* is exclusive to *Biscoe* island, and *Chinstrap* is found solely on *Dream* island.
* Sex Distribution across Species:
Another bar plot using **sns.countplot** was employed to visualise the **Sex** distribution across different penguin *species*. The observation indicated almost equal representation of both genders within each species.
- Pair Plot for Continuous Variables:
A pair plot was generated for continuous variables (**bill length**, **bill depth**, **flipper length**, and **body mass**). Distinctions among the three penguin species are more pronounced when each variable is plotted against the common variable of *bill length*.

# Part 2 : Project "An Iris Dataset Analysis"

## Introduction

Fisher's Iris Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, created by the British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. It contains measurements of three different species of iris flowers, including **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**. This dataset has become a fundamental benchmark for classification and pattern recognition tasks, serving as a foundation for various statistical and machine learning algorithms.  

## Dataset Overview: Pandas Exploration

The analysis starts with an overview of the famous Iris dataset using the Pandas library. This dataset is a popular choice in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification tasks and I have used Pandas to load, analyze, and manipulate the information contained in the CSV file downloaded, gaining insights into its structure and characteristics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis: Plotting and Identifying Patterns

**Entropy Formula for Weak Discrimination**
In the exploratory data analysis phase of the project, I delve into the Iris dataset's features and target variables exploring the concept of entropy as a measure of information gain and use it to understand how well certain features can discriminate between different flower species.

**If Boolean Statements for Linear Discrimination**
To further understand the data, I have implemented conditional statements (if-else) to perform linear discrimination based on selected features. By applying these Boolean statements, it is possible to identify linear boundaries that can help classify Iris flowers into different species.

## Machine Learning and Flower Species Prediction: Scikit-learn Library

In the final phase of the project, I leverage the power of the Scikit-learn library to build machine learning models for flower species prediction.
